Decentralized Creator is a platform devoted to free speech. We believe that free speech is a fundamental human right. Decentralized Creator is a platform that intends to mitigate and respond to concerns revolved around censorship.

## Running the web app for development

```bash
# install node modules
yarn

# run dev server
ng serve --port 4200
```

## Building for beta and production environments

```bash
# build for the beta environment
ng build -c beta

# build for the production environment
ng build -c production # `ng build --prod` works too

# launch and serve with pm2
yarn global add pm2
pm2 serve.js --name beta-dc
```

*Please note that the build configurations are pulled from `src/environments`. You will need to have the API setup in order for the web application to work. Make sure to update the base API urls according to your own custom build.*
